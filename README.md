# Weather App

This is yet another weather app. Unoriginal, I know, but don't blame the app, blame the availability of good APIs. :)

## Using the app

This app is available on Heroku: https://boyle-weather-app.herokuapp.com/

I recommend using it there rather than cloning the project. 

## Why I made this

This is primarily a personal project for my own learning. It's a build-from-scratch Node application that also employs Express and Handlebars for routing and templating.

## Next ideas

I'd like to improve the mobile-responsiveness.

I'd also perhaps add some visuals, transitions, etc. It's very basic at the moment.
